            We collect both Personal Data and Usage Data with the goals of providing and improving our Platform,
            conducting our operations, communicating with you, and enabling visitors to our Platform to enjoy and easily
            navigate it
          </li>
          <li>
            When we refer to “Personal Data” in this Policy, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes
            or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to
            a specific person. This might be information that directly identifies someone, such as their name, or it may
            be information that identifies someone only when combined with other information available to us, such as a
            person’s activity on our Platform when associated with their username. Please note, except as provided under
            applicable laws, Personal Data does not include information that is publicly available through government
            records or information that has been deidentified or aggregated in a way that it cannot be used to identify

            you use when you interact with our Platform through the normal operation of our Platform and through the use
            of cookies, pixels, and other web technologies (collectively, “Usage Data”). Usage Data, by itself,
            generally does not identify the specific person using the device that generated it. This means that Usage
            Data usually will not be considered Personal Data and our use of such Usage Data is not subject to this
            Policy unless required pursuant to applicable law. However, if we link Usage Data directly with other
            Personal Data or other information that could identify you, we will treat the linked Usage Data as Personal
            Data and use the linked Usage Data as described in this Policy.
